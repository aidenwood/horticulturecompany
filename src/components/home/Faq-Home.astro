    question: "What's involved in lighting design consultions?",
    answer:
      'We start with understanding your event vision, theme, and budget. Our designers then create custom lighting plans that enhance your space while complementing other design elements. For weddings and corporate events, we can color-match your branding or theme. We use professional lighting design software to visualize the final result, and can provide concept images before installation for your approval. Every lighting solution is built specifically for your unique event requirements.',

    question: "What areas do you service?",
    answer:
      'While we primarily service the Gold Coast, Brisbane, and Northern NSW regions including Byron Bay, as a Nationally recognised Lighting and Vision Designer (LX and VX), we\'re happy to fly anywhere in Australia for your event. Our local knowledge of venues throughout these regions is extensive, which helps us deliver seamless execution regardless of location. For destination events, please contact us with details so we can discuss logistics and availability.',

    question: 'Are your lighting systems weatherproof?',
    answer:
      "We offer a range of IP-rated outdoor lighting solutions designed to withstand various weather conditions. Our festoon and fairy lighting is specifically designed for outdoor use, and we take extensive precautions with all electrical systems. For events during storm season, we can advise on the best weather-resistant options and contingency plans. Safety is our priority, and all installations comply with relevant electrical safety standards.",

    question: 'How far in advance should I book?',
    answer:
      'For wedding and event lighting during peak season (October-March), we recommend booking at least 3-4 weeks in advance for us to make the most of your event. Corporate events typically require 4-8 weeks notice, while smaller installations might be accommodated with less lead time depending on our schedule. Festival lighting should be arranged as soon as your event is confirmed. Contact us early to ensure availability and allow adequate time for custom design work.',

    question: 'What projector services do you offer?',
    answer:
      'We provide high-quality projector hire ranging from powerful 10K lumens units for large venues to more intimate solutions. Our services include projection mapping onto buildings, custom surfaces, and stage designs to create immersive visual experiences. We can develop custom content for your projection needs or work with your existing visuals. Each projection setup is carefully calibrated to ensure sharp, vibrant images that make maximum impact for your event or installation.',

    id: 'faq-7',
    question: 'What are your pack-down options?',
    answer:
      'We include standard next-day morning pack-downs at no additional cost with all our lighting hire packages. However, we understand that some venues require immediate pack-down after an event ends. We offer late-night pack-down services for a small additional fee, allowing you to completely clear the venue immediately after your event concludes. This option is particularly valuable for venues with tight turnaround times or when you need to vacate the premises promptly.',
  },

    id: 'faq-8',
    question: 'Do you offer synchronised lighting and visual shows?',
    answer:
      'Absolutely! Under our Aidxn Design brand (visit aidxn.com for more information), we create sophisticated BPM-synchronized lighting shows that pulse and move perfectly with your music. Our visual productions combine lighting, projection, and digital content to create immersive experiences that elevate any event. These custom-programmed shows can be tailored to your brand, event theme, or musical style, creating memorable moments that truly impress your audience.',
